## input
Starting materials of molecular generation using TRACER.

## QSAR
Dataset for QSAR model training.

## USPTO
Dataset for training of Transformer and GCN.

## beamsearch_template_list.txt
>Reaction templates for which only one suitable product exists, such as deprotection of nucleophilic substituents, are manually annotated to indices of reaction templates. These templates are considered to generate only a single molecule.

In this file, indices of reaction templates to generate multiple products are annotated.

## label_template.json
Indices of reaction templates and coressponding SMARTS strings.
